    <div>
        <p>You're a thrill-seeker who has just entered an old, seemingly haunted mansion. You heard a legend that a great treasure lies within, but many have entered and never returned. The door slams shut behind you, and you realize you have to make some quick decisions.</p>
        <p>You're in the entrance hall. Ahead, there's a staircase. To the right, an opened door with an emblem. What do you do?</p>

      <p>I want to <a href="stairs.html">head up the staircase</a>.</p>
      <p>I want to <a href="door.html">go through the door</a>.</p>
